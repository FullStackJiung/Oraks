Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2026-09-25

[Oraks] (“the App”) recognizes the importance of user privacy and complies with applicable privacy laws. The App minimizes the collection of personally identifiable information and discloses the following policy.

1. Information We Collect
The App does not ask users to create accounts, log in, or provide personal details.
However, the App integrates third-party SDKs that may automatically collect data:

Google AdMob (Advertising)

Advertising identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID)
App usage data related to ads (impressions, clicks, errors)
Approximate location information for ad targeting
Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
Google Play Billing (In-App Purchases)

Purchase requests and purchase tokens required to process transactions
Payment information is handled directly by Google; the App developer does not access or store detailed payment data.
2. How We Use Information
Data collected by AdMob is used by Google to deliver and optimize ads. The developer does not store or process this data for personal identification.
Purchase information supplied by Google Play Billing is used solely to fulfill in-app purchases and deliver virtual goods (e.g., coins).
No additional secondary use or storage occurs on the developer’s servers.
3. Data Retention and Storage
The App itself does not store personal data. Any data collected by AdMob or Google Play Billing is retained according to Google’s own policies.
Users can reset or limit personalized ads from the Android system settings.

4. Data Sharing with Third Parties
For advertising and billing features, the App shares information only with:

Google LLC (AdMob, Google Play Billing) – as described above
No other third-party sharing occurs.
5. User Rights
Users may manage ad personalization or reset the advertising ID via Google’s advertising settings (https://adssettings.google.com).
Refunds or purchase issues are handled via Google Play purchase history and Google support.
6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13. If a child uses the App, a parent or guardian should supervise usage. The developer does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
